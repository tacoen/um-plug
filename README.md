#UM-Plug

UM Themes core and tool kits, a Wordpress developer Toolkit for creating/ maintaining/ optimizing a theme.

## UM-Themes

UM stand for Undress ME, a "starter themes" and (less commonly) "naked themes" eventually "bones".
You could use UM-Plug for almost(almost!) every themes, but it would be so much better if you use [UM-Core](https://github.com/tacoen/um-theme) as parent themes (since 1.0.0).

UM is base on **_s** [Underscores.me](http://underscores.me)
