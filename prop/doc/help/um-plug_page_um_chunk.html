<h3>Chunks</h3>
<p>Seriously, Long before there was a widget, we use "chunk".</p>

<p>Chunks also avaliable as shortcode and php tags, a better why to include static files to your post or your template design.</p>

<p><strong>Ideas: </strong> Google analytic code, Twitter API code, etc. or anything that you like to embed to your themes instead your Databases.</p>

<p><strong>Since 1.1.7</strong> Chunks was stored inside your /upload directory, not in child theme directory</p>
