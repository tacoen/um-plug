<h3>Yes. Get Head-started!</h3>

<p>Thank you for using UM-Theme. We mean to speed up your workflow by reducing the amount of code you need to write.</p>

<p>If you familiar with CSS, HTML5 and PHP, than UM is for you to customize, but if were into deadline, you can start with
style.css at your Child Theme for a kick start.</p>

<p>UM stand for Undress ME, a "starter themes" and (less commonly) "naked themes"
eventually "bones".</p>
